# Hotel_revenue_historical_analysis
This SQL project focuses on analyzing the historical revenue data of a hotel. It aims to gain insights into the hotel's financial performance over time by examining various revenue-related aspects.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing hotel reservation data for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. The data set that I used for this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ferranindata/hotel-revenue-data-project). The dataset includes information such as reservation details, guest demographics, room types, market segments, and revenue-related fields.

## Code

The provided code includes SQL queries to answer key questions about the hotel's revenue and visitor statistics. Here is a summary of the queries:

Total Revenue by Hotel and Year: Calculates the total revenue of the hotel by hotel type (e.g., Resort Hotel or City Hotel) and year.

Total Revenue by Room Type: Calculates the total revenue of the hotel by room type.

Total Revenue by Month: Calculates the total revenue of the hotel for each month.

Total Revenue by Customer Type and Month: Calculates the total revenue of the hotel by customer type (e.g., Transient, Contract, Group) and month.

Number of Visitors by Hotel Type and Year: Calculates the number of visitors to the hotel by hotel type and year.

Number of Visitors by Month: Calculates the number of visitors to the hotel for each month.

## Running the Project

To run this project, follow these steps:

Set up a MySQL database and import the provided hotel reservation dataset.

Execute the provided SQL queries in the given order to obtain the desired analysis results.

## Further Analysis

Feel free to modify the queries or add new ones to perform additional analysis based on your specific needs and questions.

### Note: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to the database and dataset before running the project.

### Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project is for demonstration purposes only and may not reflect real hotel data.
